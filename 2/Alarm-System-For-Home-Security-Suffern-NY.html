<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send mobile phone notifies with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
