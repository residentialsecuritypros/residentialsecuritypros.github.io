When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send mobile phone notifies with that information when they appear at your home.

We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
