<p>Another crucial subject to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend how much suffices.

The very same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much image info as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

This more recent version is similar, to be frank.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera individually, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
