Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to ignore items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
