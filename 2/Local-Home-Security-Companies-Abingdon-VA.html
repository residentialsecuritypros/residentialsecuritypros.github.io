<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to find it.
