<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level.
