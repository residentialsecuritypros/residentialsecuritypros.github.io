<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system spots a burglary, fire, or other emergency situation, it notifies the security team and, in many cases, emergency responders. Regrettably, history has shown that surveillance innovations put in place for one function inevitably expand into other usages. And with video innovation likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems should be able to do presents a significant risk.</p>
