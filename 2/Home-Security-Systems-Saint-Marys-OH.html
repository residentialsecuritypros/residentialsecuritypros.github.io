<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this article, it will sure make you feel virtually vulnerable. The other notable things about the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo design which I'm going to go over in just a 2nd), it is developed for outdoor along with indoor usage, so it'll work come rain or shine.

<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it given that its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
<p>Wireless: Wireless security cameras send data either through radio frequencies or over a Wi-Fi network.
