It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even identify people you have actually labeled (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment.

We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
