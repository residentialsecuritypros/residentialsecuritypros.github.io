In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
