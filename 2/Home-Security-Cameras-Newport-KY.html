<p>In the past, a surveillance security system generally included a number of cameras connected-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which taped the images and showed them on a closed circuit tv (CCTV) or monitor. Nowadays, it's much easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or several, they work with your home's internet network to send video footage right to your computer or mobile device. Most consumer cameras keep information internally, on a detachable microSD card, or remotely on the cloud.</p>
<p>Lots of security companies outsource their monitoring service to 3rd parties - causing interruptions, interaction breakdown, and delays in action time.
