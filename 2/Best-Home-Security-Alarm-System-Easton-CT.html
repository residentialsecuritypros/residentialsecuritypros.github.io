<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
