<p>To assess response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensing units. Nevertheless, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a personal security personnel. Several cities also require an authorization to even operate a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are designed to restrict the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms.
