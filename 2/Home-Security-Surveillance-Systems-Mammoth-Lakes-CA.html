<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If capturing video in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
