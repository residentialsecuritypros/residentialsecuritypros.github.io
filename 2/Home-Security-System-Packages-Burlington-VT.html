<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control board (generally located in the entrance hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensing units have been set off, smart alarms are managed from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and alerts you if any of the sensing units have been activated, rather than getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly annoying your neighbours).

The greatest image quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
