<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and family and friends) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send alerts, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
