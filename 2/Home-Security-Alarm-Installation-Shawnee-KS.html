<h2>Should You Self Monitor Your Alarm System Shawnee</h2>
<p>The Abode Smart Security Package, our previous runner-up, is still a strong option for some individuals.

Both the original Abode system and the Home Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only design we tested that also deals with HomeKit. We have actually come across a couple of technical problems while long-term screening the Home Iota, therefore will continue to test and upgrade appropriately. We no longer advise it.</p>
<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. You can activate a video clip or a SmartThings automation if your camera detects motion or sound.
