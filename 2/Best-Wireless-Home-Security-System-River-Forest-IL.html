<p>Despite the fact that 1080p is normally the basic resolution for cameras we have actually tested, there are advantages to models with higher-resolution sensors. Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but practically all have digital zoom, which crop and increase the size of whatever the camera is recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things plainly.</p>
<p>These cameras do not need a video capture card since they work using a digital signal which can be conserved straight to a computer system. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is basic for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the quantity of space to be used up versus the quality of image needed or preferred). The greatest picture quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
