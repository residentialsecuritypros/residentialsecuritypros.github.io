<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one?

The gadget collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and develops an electronic image based on info about the temperature level differences. Since things are seldom exactly the same temperature level as other objects around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
