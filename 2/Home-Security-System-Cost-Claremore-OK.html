<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
