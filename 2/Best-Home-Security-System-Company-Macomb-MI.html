Unless you just have one door and one window, you'll need more than the lone contact sensor that comes in Ring's five-piece package.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition.

We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
