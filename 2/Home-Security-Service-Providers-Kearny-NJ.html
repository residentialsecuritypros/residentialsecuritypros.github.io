<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so important?  For starters, Deep Learning enables someone to discover what they are searching for without needing to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Envision a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the aspects you are searching for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a police vehicle in it, we simply type cops" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police cruiser appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have an effective service for catching bad guys and gathering evidence.</p>
