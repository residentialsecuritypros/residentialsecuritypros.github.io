Dependability has long been at the heart of the dispute over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's a debate that's typically manipulated by aspects such as hesitation over the vulnerability of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and glitches that trigger incorrect alarms. While improvements in the last few years have actually made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own unique wireless technology, which can't be hindered by other signals), issues continue over vulnerabilities that do not impact hardwired systems.</p>
<p>The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we might revisit this evaluation.</p>

<p>There are also wireless IP cameras offered that require bit more than installing, but those may be less secure than wired connections. If you pick wireless, you'll need to make sure the signal can't be quickly intercepted. Again, it all returns to your particular requirements and the type of system you're trying to construct.</p>
