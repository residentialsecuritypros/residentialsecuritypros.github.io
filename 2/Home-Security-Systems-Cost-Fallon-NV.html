<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>The report, entitled Is your CCTV system secure from cyber attack?, states there are "significant vulnerabilities" in both traditional DVR-based CCTV systems, in addition to cloud-based video systems. Hackers can "easily" hijack connections to the gadget's IP address, putting a great deal of individuals, their homes and data at threat. </p>
