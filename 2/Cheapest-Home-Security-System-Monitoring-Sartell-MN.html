<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers understand that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
