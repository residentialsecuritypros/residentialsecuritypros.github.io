<h3>Good Home Security Systems in Illinois</h3>

<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such occurrences. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we don't believe that these problems change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our existing suggestion.</p>
