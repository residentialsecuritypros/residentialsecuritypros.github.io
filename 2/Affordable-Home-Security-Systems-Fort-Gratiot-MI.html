<p>While every homeowner frets about break-ins, suspicion has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high expenses, complicated agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically leading to incorrect alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system connected together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, supplying trustworthy video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we created security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're reinventing the smart home. Firsts like Blue are what we do.
