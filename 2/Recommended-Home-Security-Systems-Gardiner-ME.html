<p>Our alarm systems might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an offense. Once a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
