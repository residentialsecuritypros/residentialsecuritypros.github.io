<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, spanning several years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems readily available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to record video and view it later.

<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, informs, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
