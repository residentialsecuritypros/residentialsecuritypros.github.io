<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
<p>The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was faulty, therefore we might revisit this evaluation.</p>
