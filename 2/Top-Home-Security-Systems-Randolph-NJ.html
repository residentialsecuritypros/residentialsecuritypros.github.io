<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
