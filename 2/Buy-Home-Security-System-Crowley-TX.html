<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially noticed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send notifies, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>Blue by ADT uses customized DIY home security equipment that can be tailored to your present lifestyle with the capability to grow, move, and adapt to your progressing requirements-- all backed by 145 years of competence. Either way, there's no contract and you can cancel your service at any time with no charges. Just understand that if you pay for a year of monitoring up front, you can't get a prorated refund if you wish to cancel-- you'll just get the full year of monitoring.</p>
<p>So what happens if something triggers your alarm however you're in a conference with a vendor and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed holiday and your spotty cell service means you do not get informed until the next day? The sound may frighten off prospective trespassers-- if you're lucky if your system equipment includes an audible alarm. However the police will not come until you personally call them. </p>
