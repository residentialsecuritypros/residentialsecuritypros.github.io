Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
