<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management options for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, hotels, and others. Some alarm serve a single purpose of robbery protection; combination systems offer both fire and intrusion protection. Intrusion alarm might also be combined with closed-circuit tv surveillance (CCTV) systems to immediately tape the activities of burglars, and might interface to gain access to control systems for electrically locked doors. Systems range from small, self-contained noisemakers, to complicated, multirally systems with computer system monitoring and control.

For most homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly.
