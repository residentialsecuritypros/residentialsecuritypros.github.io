<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, however after reading this article, it will sure make you feel essentially vulnerable. The other notable features of the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo model which I'm going to go over in simply a 2nd), it is developed for outdoor as well as indoor use, so it'll work come rain or shine.

We love that it features both internal and external sirens and will even work with Philips Hue clever lights, too. The instructions are incredibly thorough and the 200m range of the alarm implies it can be used to safeguard garages and sheds as well as your home.
