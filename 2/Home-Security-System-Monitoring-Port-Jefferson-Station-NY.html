<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
