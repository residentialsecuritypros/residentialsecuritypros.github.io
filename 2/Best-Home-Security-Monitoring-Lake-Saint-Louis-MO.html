<p>One vital exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 per month, which could be an affordable choice for customers in rural areas.

A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
