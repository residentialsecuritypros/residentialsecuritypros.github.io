<p>A self-monitored security system is typically created to be basic so you can install it yourself without problem. However it might lack the needed sophistication of an expertly monitored system.

Nevertheless, wise alarms do need a hub that permits the different elements to wirelessly link. But for a lot of clever alarms this hub can be put anywhere in your home.</p>

In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
