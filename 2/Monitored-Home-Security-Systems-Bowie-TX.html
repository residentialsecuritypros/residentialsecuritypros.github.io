<h2>Should Your Home Alarm System Be Monitored Or Unmonitored Bowie</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering several decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually developed into the highly advanced yet affordable systems readily available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape-record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>Completely wire-free cameras also remove the threat of somebody cutting the cable to stop the feed. Prepared to see what our experts would suggest for burglar alarm systems?
