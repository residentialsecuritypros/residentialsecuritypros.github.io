The implicit reason for the current push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. But suicide attackers are clearly not discouraged by video cameras - and might even be brought in to the tv protection cameras can ensure - and the expense of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far goes beyond the limited advantages that the system may supply in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the reality (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
