<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the shop.

Being able to distinguish between an individual and a car, for instance, permits you to minimize unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the yard, a doorway, and even garbage cans. </p>
