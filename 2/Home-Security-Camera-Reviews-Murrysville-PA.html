A few minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply would not connect.

After about 10 minutes, he might inform there was an issue with the circuit board. Definitely not perfect-- however the representative asked forgiveness and shipped her replacement control panel overnight.</p>
