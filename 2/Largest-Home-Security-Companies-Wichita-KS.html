The app is hugely impressive, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, developing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or showing up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the early morning - are refreshingly simple.</p>

Nevertheless, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a private security personnel. Several cities likewise require an authorization to even run a home and own security system. Rules such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>The second important thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly raucous in-built alarm, so it operates as a home alarm as well as a security camera.
