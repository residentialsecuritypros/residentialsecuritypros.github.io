Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Being able to compare a person and a car, for instance, enables you to cut down on unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, particularly if you're seeking to monitor a specific corner of the yard, a doorway, and even trash bin. </p>
