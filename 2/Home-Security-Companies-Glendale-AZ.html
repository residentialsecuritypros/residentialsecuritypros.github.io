<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to third party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams because they were bought by Google. Something we all need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has actually found burglars or wild animals.

It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually identified (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
