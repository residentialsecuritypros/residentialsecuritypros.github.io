<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.

We suggest cellular systems since they're much more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>You'll get current equipment from Link Interactive and a highly-rated mobile app. Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive offers up to 48 sensing units in its basic package, consisting of both fire and CO alarms.
