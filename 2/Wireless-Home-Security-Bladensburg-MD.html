<p>When combined with face recognition, surveillance camera networks raise additional personal privacy and civil rights issues-- particularly due to the fact that face recognition data is susceptible to mistake.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially revolutionary, so we're really advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower price if you opt for a three-year agreement, but considering that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So select what will be the better offer for you. If you understand you'll sit tight for at least 3 years, opt for the agreement and enjoy those cost savings. But if you may upgrade to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>
