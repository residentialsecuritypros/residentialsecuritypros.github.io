<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If capturing footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>To investigate the best security system for your needs, decide if you desire video monitoring, whether you desire voice recognition features, and how technically smart you are in terms of how easy the system will be to utilize on a day-to-day basis.
