<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the needed systems is essential. If there are no as-built documents providing performance and setup information to make this combination work, there are only two alternatives. The very first alternative, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is unavailable or reluctant to provide those details) and document the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and replace, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>

In doing so, it can potentially protect your home from flooding, fire, or even quickly changing temperature levels.</p>
