<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the producer's stats given that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt.

No-contract systems, which permit you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-lasting arrangement, are ending up being more typical. These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement. Paying for the equipment in advance supplies you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can stop the monitoring and start service as sometimes as you desire.</p>
