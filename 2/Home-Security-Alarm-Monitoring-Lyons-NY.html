<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security considering that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
