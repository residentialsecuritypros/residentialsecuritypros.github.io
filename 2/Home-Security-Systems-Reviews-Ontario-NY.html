Just like gain access to codes, there can likewise be a hierarchy of oral codes, say, for heater repairperson to enter the kitchen area and basement sensing unit areas but not the silver vault in the pantry.

<p>Throughout the spring and summer months, home security or alarm companies work with traveling sales representatives to go door-to-door, making unsolicited "sales calls" on house owners. In some cases, the salesmen use high-pressure or deceptive sales tactics to get potential customers to buy pricey, and often substandard, systems or equipment they don't need.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something activates your alarm but you remain in a conference with a vendor and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've lastly gone on a much-needed trip and your spotty cell service means you don't get notified up until the next day?
