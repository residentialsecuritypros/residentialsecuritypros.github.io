<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera individually, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
