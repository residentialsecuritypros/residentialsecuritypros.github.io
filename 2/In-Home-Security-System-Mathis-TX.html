<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensors, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>

<p>Another crucial subject to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend just how much suffices. In this article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The very same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about four times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security given that it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
