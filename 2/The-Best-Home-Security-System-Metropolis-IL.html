<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams considering that they were bought by Google. Something we all require to consider. Sirens. So your camera has identified burglars or wild animals. Do you want to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your smart outlets with your general security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can manage your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
