<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular since the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
