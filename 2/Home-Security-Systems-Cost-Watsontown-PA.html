Other jobs will necessitate using conduit - piping for running the electrical wiring and securing it - and sometimes, removing part of the wall to lay wiring inside.

<p>We tried each of the cameras in numerous locations around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service.

Although FrontPoint uses a wide variety of equipment and home automation products at a sensible price, the one area where the company particularly stands out is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
