Which's what Nest gives you.</p>
<p>There's a central 100db siren here too (silenced by the top button) which could be useful if your cameras are all mounted outside - and doing so isn't an issue, with each carrying an IP65 ranking that indicates they'll hold up against a jet from a tube. For repairing, you have the alternative of either a strong magnetic ball mount or a basic tripod screw.</p>
