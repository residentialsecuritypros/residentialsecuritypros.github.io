<p>Additionally, devices that link through Wi-Fi, such as security cameras and clever door locks, can be hacked to gain access to your home network. A knowledgeable hacker can then utilize your Wi-Fi gadgets and other network resources to carry out Distributed Rejection of Service (DDoS) attacks versus larger networks.

<p>Vivint's equipment is the most technically advanced of all the security companies on our list.

<p>London has more than 10,000 CCTV cameras whirring away 24 hours a day.

It works either connected to power or with its built-in battery-- and it's the only Canary camera that you can utilize within and outdoors.</p>
<p>In fact, government action was just recently taken versus Vivint because the company had problems with supposed misrepresentation of provided services and hiring unlicensed company representatives.

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name recommends, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. But beyond that I simply had problems.

I was performing the macarena in front of the camera for about two minutes before it even observed I existed. </p>
