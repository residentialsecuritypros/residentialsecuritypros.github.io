With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially noticed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send signals, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
