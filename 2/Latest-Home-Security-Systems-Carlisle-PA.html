<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
