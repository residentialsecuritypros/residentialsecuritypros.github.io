However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have extra sensors and essential fobs, too.</p>
