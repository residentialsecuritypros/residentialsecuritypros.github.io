<p>A little more costly than our winning clever alarm, this system was nearly as simple to install and, during screening, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensing units had actually been activated. We enjoy that the system includes a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is produced by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false alerts). However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have essential fobs and additional sensing units, too.</p>
