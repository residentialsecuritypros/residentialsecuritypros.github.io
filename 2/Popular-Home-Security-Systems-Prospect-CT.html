<p>We like all the functions the Kasa Area uses that make it such excellent worth and one of the very best security cameras on the marketplace: two-way audio, night vision, 1080p HD recording, customized activity zones and more. The camera can tape video in as much as 1080p, which looks perfectly fine on a mobile phone screen and won't tax your web connection excessive.
