The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after practically 2 years of night, day and use images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we encountered when checking the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.
