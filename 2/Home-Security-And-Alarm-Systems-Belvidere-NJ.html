<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
