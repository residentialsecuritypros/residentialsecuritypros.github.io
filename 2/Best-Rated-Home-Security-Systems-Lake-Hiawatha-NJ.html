<p>A number of other designs were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
