<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
