<h2>Security & Surveillance Cameras Mountville</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, covering a number of years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then transmitted over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be established to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>ELERTS is a free smart device app that allows residents who see something suspicious to take an image and rapidly send it to public safety authorities.

Reports from cellphone users can be quickly evaluated and acted upon by Public Safety officials.</p>
