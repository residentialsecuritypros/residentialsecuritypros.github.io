<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms occur.

That person at Deep Sentinel's center can alert a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they decline to engage or leave in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
