For example, you can create guidelines to have the lights turn on when motion is found, have your doors unlock when a smoke detector goes off, and have a camera begin taping when a sensing unit is set off. Some systems keep recorded video locally on an SD card or a solid state drive, while others offer cloud storage. Locally saved video is a good option for do-it-yourselfers on a budget, but you have to take care not to overwrite video you might require later. Cloud storage makes it easy to store and gain access to taped video, however it can cost hundreds of dollars annually depending upon your subscription.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security since it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
