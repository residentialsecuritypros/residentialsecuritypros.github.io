You get a notification in your smart device app if your motion sensing unit is set off. There's no latency so you get alerted right away so you can take immediate actions such as triggering a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or utilizing the camera's two-way audio system to talk with the prospective burglars.</p>
<p>Wireless sensors secure all points of entry. Light, discreet & simple to position up to 200ft. from the panel.
