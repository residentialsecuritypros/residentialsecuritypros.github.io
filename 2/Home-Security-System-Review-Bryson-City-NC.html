With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms take place.

<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly cost for a set amount of time, usually one to five years. No-contract systems, which permit you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-term plan, are ending up being more typical.
