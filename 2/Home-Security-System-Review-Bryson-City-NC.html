<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly cost for a set amount of time, usually one to five years. No-contract systems, which permit you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-term plan, are ending up being more typical.
