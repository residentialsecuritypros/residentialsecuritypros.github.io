<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
