<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the essentials. But while ADT systems work with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems don't.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system detects a burglary, fire, or other emergency situation, it notifies the security group and, in many cases, emergency situation responders.

And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear borders for what CCTV systems need to have the ability to do poses a considerable risk.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their fast reaction times and total flexibility. And managing our system with their touchscreen panel was quite darn and effortless smooth. Otherwise, this company uses a comparable feature-set as brand names like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is readily available today, it's safe to say that the wireless systems are just as good, if not better, than the wired systems. Provided all of the other benefits, it's easy to see why so many people are choosing this option. </p>
