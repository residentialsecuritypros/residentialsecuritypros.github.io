We initially noticed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.
