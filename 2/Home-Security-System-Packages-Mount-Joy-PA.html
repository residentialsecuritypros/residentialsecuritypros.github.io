The latter allows you to see precisely when a particular individual gets to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has actually broadened its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units known as Tags (₤ 89.99).
