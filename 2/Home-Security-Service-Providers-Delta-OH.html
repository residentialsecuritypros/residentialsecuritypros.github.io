<h2>Video Surveillance Cameras Delta</h2>

The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of area to be taken up versus the quality of picture required or wanted). The highest photo quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>

<p>No. Monitored medical alarms are not included in this new law. These alarms differ from panic alarms, which are covered. Panic alarms receive authorities action based upon worry of impending injury or bodily damage due to criminal activity, while medical alarms normally get fire action based upon an emergency situation due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.</p>
