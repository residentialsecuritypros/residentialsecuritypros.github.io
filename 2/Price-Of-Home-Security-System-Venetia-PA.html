<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Readily Available. Standard parts in the majority of home security packages consist of a master control panel, the control keypad, sensor pads for windows and doors and a motion sensor gadget. Some systems are linked to an offsite alarm monitoring service, while others have in-home alarms. Obviously you can buy more equipment like surveillance cameras, glass break sensing units, CO detectors and smoke detector.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally referred to as shock sensors, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
