<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the precise same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
