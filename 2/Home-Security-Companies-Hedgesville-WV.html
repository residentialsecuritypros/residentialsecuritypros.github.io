<p>To assess response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensors. Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private security personnel. Several cities also need an authorization to even operate a home and own security system. Rules such as these are designed to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many towns will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>

<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of innovation.

When a client presses the emergency button, it sends dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if needed, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
