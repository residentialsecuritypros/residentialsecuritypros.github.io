<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion.
