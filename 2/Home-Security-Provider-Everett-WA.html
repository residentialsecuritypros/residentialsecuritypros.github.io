<p>What actually sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is essential.

Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Having the ability to distinguish between a person and a cars and truck, for example, allows you to reduce unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the yard, a doorway, and even trash bin. </p>
