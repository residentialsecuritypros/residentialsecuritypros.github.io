In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security personnel. Several cities also require an authorization to even own and operate a home security system. Guidelines such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>

We've seen it highlight vehicles, mice, and moths.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

We likewise discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
