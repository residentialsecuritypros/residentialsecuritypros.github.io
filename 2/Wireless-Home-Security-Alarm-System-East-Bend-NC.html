Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.
