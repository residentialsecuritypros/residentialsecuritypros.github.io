<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically much safer, but after reading this article, it will sure make you feel essentially susceptible. A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply wouldn't link. An aid window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep assisted her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he could tell there was an issue with the circuit board. Definitely not ideal-- however the rep asked forgiveness and delivered her replacement control board over night.</p>

And if you want to conserve 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the month-to-month plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.
