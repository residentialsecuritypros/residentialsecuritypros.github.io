<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt must be able to endure exposure to the components and need to carry an IP (Ingress Protection) rating IP scores contain 2 digits that inform you just how well the camera will hold up under a lot of weather conditions. The first digit following the IP prefix tells you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of solid items such as wind-blown dust and varies from 0 (no protection) to 6 (total protection versus dust and dirt).
