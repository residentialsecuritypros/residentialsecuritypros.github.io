<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the precise very same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric current.

Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm.
