Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
