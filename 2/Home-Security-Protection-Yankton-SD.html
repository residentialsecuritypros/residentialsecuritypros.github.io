As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
