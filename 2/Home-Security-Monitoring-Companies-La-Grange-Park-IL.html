Think of a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the elements you are looking for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we just type cops" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police cruiser appears.

Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
