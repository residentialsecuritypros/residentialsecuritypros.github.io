<h2>ACT Government Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Camera Systems Palm Desert</h2>

<p>Our alarm systems might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge a violation. Once a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
