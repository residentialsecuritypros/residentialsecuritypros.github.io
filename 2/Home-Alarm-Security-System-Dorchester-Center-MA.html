<p>While every house owner worries about break-ins, uncertainty has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high expenses, complex agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often leading to false alarms. Technology combination is one Vivint's strong points. The company's impressive mobile app has actually been highly ranked by users on both Google Play and the App Store. It enables consumers to examine live video feed, trigger and deactivate security systems, and handle their automated home systems including wise locks, the Philips Color system, and Nest and Aspect thermostats. Smart systems can connect to Google Home and Amazon Echo, for a smoother automation experience.</p>
<p>A system that requires an agreement may be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems typically do not come with upfront fees. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
