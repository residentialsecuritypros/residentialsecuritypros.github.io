<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be considered. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.
