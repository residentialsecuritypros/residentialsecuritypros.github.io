<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we agree with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive procedure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such events.

If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not think that these issues change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our existing recommendation.</p>
