<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly changing the security market, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so important?  For starters, Deep Learning allows someone to discover what they are searching for without having to search through hours of worthless video footage.  Imagine a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the aspects you are searching for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police vehicle in it, we merely type authorities" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have a powerful solution for capturing lawbreakers and collecting proof.</p>
<p>If you're trying to find motion detection, the Canary Flex includes an intelligent version that sends out notifies directly to your phone. This camera uses a wide range of features consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I explained it as decidedly middle of the roadway. Not great, not awful, however with an actually simple setup process (and trust me, that actually is a killer feature when it pertains to wise cameras.) This newer variation is similar, to be frank.</p>
<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is vital. In reality, we do not recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Having the ability to distinguish between a person and a car, for instance, enables you to reduce unneeded notifies. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, and even garbage cans. </p>
