<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
