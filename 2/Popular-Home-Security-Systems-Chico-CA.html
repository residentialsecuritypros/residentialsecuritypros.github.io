<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires.

Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.

(A four-camera pack expenses $504.72 at the time of writing.) However we can't fault Arlo excessive for that-- any premium multi-camera system is going to strike your wallet hard.</p>
