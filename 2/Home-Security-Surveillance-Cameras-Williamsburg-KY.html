<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If catching footage in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
