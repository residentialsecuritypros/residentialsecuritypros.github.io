It can be uncomfortable and sluggish to utilize on occasion - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather sluggish at times. The previous, more affordable version of the outdoor Nest cam is still on sale too if you wish to save some money - it does have a cable connected however, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit simpler to screw up for prospective burglars.
