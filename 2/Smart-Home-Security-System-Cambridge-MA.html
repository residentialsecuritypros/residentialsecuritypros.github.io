<p>If you do come across a home intrusion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am a little dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm.

Regardless of that, the alarm ought to be enough to frighten trespassers in most cases. To recover costs and hold alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be licensed, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and offer physical proof like camera footage or a damaged window to warrant cops action.</p>
