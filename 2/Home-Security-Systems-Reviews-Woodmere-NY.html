The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of area to be taken up versus the quality of image needed or desired).

Typically you would discover a PCB with numerous terminals or antennas for connections. Many likewise have integrated backup batteries for wired systems and a phone or ethernet line in or out port. Some may have a serial port for connection to a professional's computer system for diagnostics. These are the real heart of the system.
