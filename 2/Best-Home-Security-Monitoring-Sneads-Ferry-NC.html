<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search innovation that is rapidly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so crucial?  For beginners, Deep Knowing permits somebody to discover what they are searching for without needing to search through hours of useless video footage.  Imagine a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the components you are searching for in the taped video footage.

The systems with video storage normally include either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage option saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself.

Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, however low signal strength and poor connection are still common complaints. Hardwired systems need minimal maintenance, and short of a basic power blackout, are harder to interrupt. In spite of a general improvement in wireless technology, there seem less ways for hardwired systems to be interrupted and immobilized. </p>
