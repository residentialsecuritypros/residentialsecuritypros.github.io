<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt should have the ability to hold up against direct exposure to the components and must bring an IP (Ingress Protection) rating IP ratings include 2 digits that tell you simply how well the camera will hold up under a lot of climate condition.

The second number informs you how resistant the camera is to moisture and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 9 (protected versus close quarters, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
