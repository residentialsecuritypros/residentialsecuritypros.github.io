However, you will have to pay for additional $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) per month, and this does not featured professional monitoring. This additional cost isn't ideal, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- respective minimum prices monthly for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a take. </p>
