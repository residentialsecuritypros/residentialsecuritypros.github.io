<p>This nifty clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout screening, we discovered it was basic to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly activating when movement was identified. We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly. It's also worth noting that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we evaluated and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>
