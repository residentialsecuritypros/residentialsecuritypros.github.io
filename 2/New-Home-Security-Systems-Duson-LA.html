Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge.

I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out informs, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
