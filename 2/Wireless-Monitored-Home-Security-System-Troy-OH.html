<p>First and foremost, it's tough to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, however it's much better than a lot of cameras that are four times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).
