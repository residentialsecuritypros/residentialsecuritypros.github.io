<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet economical systems offered today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape-record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
