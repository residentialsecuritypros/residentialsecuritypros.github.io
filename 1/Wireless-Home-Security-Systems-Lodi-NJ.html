<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the specific same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical current.

Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
