<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Possession protection gadgets are designed to protect specific, tangible assets, such as precious jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and family heirlooms. These devices can be equipped with anti-tampering technology to prevent being deactivated. If the product to which the gadget has been attached is moved or interrupted, the sensing unit will set off an alarm.</p>
<p>While burglar alarm technology has developed considerably since the 19th century, it is still based on the basic concepts innovated by Augustus Pope and Alexander Bell. All major alarm companies, including Mijac Alarm, utilize distance sensors in the windows and doors as the first line of defense against prospective burglars, and alarm systems send information to a main monitoring station that can dispatch law enforcement rapidly and successfully.</p>
