<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
