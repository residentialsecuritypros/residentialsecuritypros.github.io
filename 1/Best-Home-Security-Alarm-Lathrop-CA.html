<h2>Tips To Secure Your Smart Home And IoT Devices Lathrop</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning a number of decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and enjoy it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
