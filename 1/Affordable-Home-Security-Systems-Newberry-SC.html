<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send out mobile phone alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
