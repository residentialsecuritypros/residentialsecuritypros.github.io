<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge.
