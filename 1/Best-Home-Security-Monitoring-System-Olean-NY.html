<p>I have this camera connected to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like.

It ended up being a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the patio by a certified electrician (who happens to be my husband).
