<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control board (typically positioned in the entrance hall) that is used to arm and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensors have actually been activated, smart alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've already left home, and notifies you if any of the sensors have been activated, rather than getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially frustrating your neighbours). However, smart alarms do require a center that enables the different components to wirelessly link. But for a lot of wise alarms this hub can be placed anywhere in your home.</p>
