It can be awkward and sluggish to utilize on occasion - with the procedure of connecting to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, less expensive version of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you wish to save some money - it does have a cable connected however, rather than working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit much easier to undermine for prospective trespassers.
