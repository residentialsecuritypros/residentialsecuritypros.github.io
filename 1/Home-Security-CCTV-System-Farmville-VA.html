<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
