<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, but we agree with its suggestion that users must reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a precautionary step. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such incidents. Nevertheless, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't think that these concerns alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our existing recommendation.</p>

<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most affordable monitoring strategy starting at $10. You can get all the fundamentals like sms, e-mail, and push alerts, along with 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's most affordable, Always On" plan.
