The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

Its dual articulating LED floodlights cover a very large location, and you can dim them through its app if you want state of mind lighting on your deck or patio area for a party.
