They provide flexibility in their equipment and available plans, allowing house owners to select the security option that best fits their needs. Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages to Protect America shown by their low C- score from BBB. A bulk of the grievances center around false information concerning the obligatory 3 year contract. In reality, many consumers were not conscious they were making such a long term commitment. This, paired with the extreme penalty for premature cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus paying for all of the equipment-may offer some pause in picking Protect America as their home security solution.</p>
