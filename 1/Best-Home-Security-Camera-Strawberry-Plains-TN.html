<p>Several other models were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of approximately 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially innovative, so we're really recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative.
