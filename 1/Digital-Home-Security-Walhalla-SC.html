<p>Because it's more complicated than it should be, we don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month.
