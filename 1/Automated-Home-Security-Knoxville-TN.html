<p>For these different systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a detailed understanding of all the needed systems is needed. If there are no as-built documents supplying functionality and configuration information to make this combination work, there are only 2 options. The very first option, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial option provider is unwilling or not available to provide those details) and document the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other technique is to rip and replace, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>Home security companies use a wide variety of equipment options, from installed control panel setups to totally automated systems controlled by tablets or smart devices. Some companies produce and sell their own proprietary equipment, while others depend on third-party products. Certain home security systems need professional installation.
