<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Of all the home security system readily available on the market today, there is not one that looks more sophisticated and elegant than Nest Secure.

Hampton Products will introduce an indoor camera under its Array by Hampton line in spring 2020. The wire-free camera has a rechargeable battery and a 130-degree viewing angle.

The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and then shops it on a disk drive for later retrieval. Screens can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>The Kasa Web Cam Outdoor is a good all-around weatherproof home security camera that costs less than $100. Nevertheless, there are a few tradeoffs with this camera. Unlike other outdoor cameras on this list, the Kasa Web cam needs to be plugged in to an outlet to receive power, and while the camera is weather-resistant, the connection in between its cable and power supply is not.</p>
