<p>1-3 Incorrect alarms: $25. It's a superior bundle but it's pricey, and to get the most out of it (like cloud storage archives or motion zones) you truly require to sign up for a subscription too.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
