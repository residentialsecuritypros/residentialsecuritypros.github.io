<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then relayed over a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be established to communicate via network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
<p>With a condensed periphery and a central focus, a fisheye lens security camera offers you a focused look at a large field of view.

What you lose in resolution, especially at the edges of your field of view, you offset in reliability.</p>
