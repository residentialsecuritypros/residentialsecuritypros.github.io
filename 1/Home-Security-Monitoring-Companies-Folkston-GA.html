<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were simple to install. Each camera has an app that strolls you through the setup procedure. This typically includes finding an area for your camera, creating an account in the app, and linking the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

You can easily arm the sensors when you leave for optimal security.

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it because its battery-saving regimens can interrupt performance.</p>
