<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I've ditched my Nest Cams since they were bought by Google. Something we all need to think about. Sirens. So your camera has actually discovered trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to frighten them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Keep in mind that these sirens may breach local noise control laws, so inspect ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>In the end, for a lot of clients, making the best option will come down to the company's customer support reputation and your particular equipment needs.

<p>When I ultimately entered the camera controls, I was fairly pleased. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the individual being seen understand they're being watched, and you can choose to tape-record video clips or images and save them to your wise device on an impulse. </p>
