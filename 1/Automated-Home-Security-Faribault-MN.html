Monitors can be linked to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>Smart device integration: If you have a home loaded with smart devices, consider trying to find a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that consists of a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or-- eventually a Thread-- radio that can connect them.
