<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires.

Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to neglect items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
