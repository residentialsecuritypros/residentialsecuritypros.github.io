<p>When you get a wireless self monitored alarm, make certain to keep the base gadget in a main area so all the different devices remain in close proximity to it. It will record clips when it sees motion (and a couple of seconds before so you get the complete view of what occurred) and you can view these for a week prior to they're deleted. You can extend the amount of days you get by acquiring a membership, however I don't think most people will require that alternative.</p>
