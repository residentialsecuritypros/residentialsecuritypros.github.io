<p>We also take a look at the functions that are available through the camera's app. Does it have such things as adjustable motion zones?

<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, due to the fact that it consists of 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds costly, but it's not a lot when you think about that a live human being is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras identify suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Guard's facility can caution a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act.
