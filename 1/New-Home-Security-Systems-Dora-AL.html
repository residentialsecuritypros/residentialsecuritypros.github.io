The typical factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying an opportunity for the harmful aggressor to record these codes and use numerous breaking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can release a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based upon the "model" security key recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>

Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires.
