On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of clever home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, however you can't include a lots of other smart home tech to the system. It won't deal with loads of smart home equipment from other companies.

Modern systems now have incredible abilities", though these have created reasonable misgivings about the threat for personal privacy and potential abuse such abilities produce.

Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service indicates you do not get signaled until the next day? If your system equipment includes an audible alarm, the noise may scare off prospective trespassers-- if you're fortunate. However the police will not come until you personally call them. </p>
