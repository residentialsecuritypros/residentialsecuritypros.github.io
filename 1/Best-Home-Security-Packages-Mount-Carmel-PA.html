We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
