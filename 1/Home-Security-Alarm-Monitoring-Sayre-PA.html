<p>While every homeowner worries about burglaries, apprehension has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complex agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently leading to false alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system connected together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, offering trustworthy video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years earlier, we developed security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're reinventing the smart home. Firsts like Blue are what we do.
