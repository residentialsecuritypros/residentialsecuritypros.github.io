The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems readily available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape video and view it later.

Due to the fact that they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality elements that can adapt and record excellent low light video, commercial cameras exceed their less expensive cousins.</p>

Regardless of a basic improvement in wireless innovation, there appear to be less ways for hardwired systems to be interfered with and paralyzed. </p>
