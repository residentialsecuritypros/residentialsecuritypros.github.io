<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the porch by a certified electrical contractor (who happens to be my other half). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
