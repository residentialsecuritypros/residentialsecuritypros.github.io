<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
