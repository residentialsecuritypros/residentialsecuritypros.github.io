<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send mobile phone notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
