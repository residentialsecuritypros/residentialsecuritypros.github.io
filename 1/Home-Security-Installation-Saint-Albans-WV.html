<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of up to one year of battery life.

<p>The Kasa Cam Outdoor is a good all-around weatherproof home security camera that costs less than $100. However, there are a couple of tradeoffs with this camera.
