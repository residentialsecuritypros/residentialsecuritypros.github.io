<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
<p>While a lot of service providers provide you the choice to include both outdoor and indoor cameras to your security bundle, SimpliSafe's selection is limited to one indoor surveillance camera. The camera consists of functions like totally free streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, but it does not take pictures of activity and can't move or pan-- basic features discovered on most surveillance cameras. </p>
