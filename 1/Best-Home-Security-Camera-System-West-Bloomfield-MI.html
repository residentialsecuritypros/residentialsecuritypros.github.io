<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
