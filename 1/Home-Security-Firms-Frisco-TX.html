However I also appreciate minimalist systems that elements that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation available to you. Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I want to ensure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>

If there are no as-built documents supplying functionality and setup information to make this integration work, there are just 2 choices.
