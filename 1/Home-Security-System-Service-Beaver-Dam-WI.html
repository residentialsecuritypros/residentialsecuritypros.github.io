The first choice, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is unavailable or unwilling to provide those information) and document the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to replace and rip, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not especially groundbreaking, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here.

Sure, you get a lower cost if you choose a three-year contract, but given that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a big commitment. So pick what will be the better offer for you. Go with the contract and gain those cost savings if you understand you'll remain put for at least three years. However if you may upgrade to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best choice.</p>
