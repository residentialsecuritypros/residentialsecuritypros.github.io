<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously impressive piece of technology. For starters, it looks beautiful: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). When you picture a home security camera, it's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you might call to mind.

<p>The first thing I take a look at in a security system are its system parts. Home security market is trying to offer new gadgets and innovation is progressing. Now, most security systems involve a great number of components, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensing units, a keypad, and key fobs, among other components. However I likewise value minimalist systems that components that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation offered to you. Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, clever lock, and so on), I want to make certain that they all quickly communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
