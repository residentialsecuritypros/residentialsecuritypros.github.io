<h3>Surveillance Security Systems in Island Lake IL</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
