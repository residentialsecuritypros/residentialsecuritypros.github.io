<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to disregard things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.
