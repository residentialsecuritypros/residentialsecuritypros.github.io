<p>Increase safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. The Ring Stick Up Webcam can be found in wired and battery variations, which can be used inside and outdoors. However neither can record constantly, and they both need the Ring Secure plan to capture recordings.

<h2>WiFi & Wireless Cameras Hermiston</h2>
<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the rate and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
