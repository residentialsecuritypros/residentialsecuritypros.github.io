<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be thought about. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.

Cloud storage makes it easy to store and access tape-recorded video, however it can cost numerous dollars per year depending on your subscription. Some systems provide both cloud storage and local storage, and some offer a devoted storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it simple to find a video event that occurred at a particular time.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect complacency since it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
