<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively common.

With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. False alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

IP cameras boast sharper, greater resolution images and more versatile functions like remote zoom and repositioning. They also give you the choice to view video footage on a web internet browser.
