A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system connected together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, offering trusted video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years earlier, we developed security and alarm monitoring services.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
