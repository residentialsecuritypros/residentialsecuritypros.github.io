<p>Not just do the Arlo Ultra's 4K cameras provide the best home security camera video, but it likewise utilizes that additional resolution to make it possible for digital track and zoom, that makes it simpler to id an individual and follow as they move across the frame.

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
