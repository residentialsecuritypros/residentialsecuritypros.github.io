<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view.

It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you've labeled (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
