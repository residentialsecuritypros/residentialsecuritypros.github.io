<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>While most providers offer you the option to include both indoor and outdoor cameras to your security package, SimpliSafe's selection is limited to one indoor surveillance camera.
