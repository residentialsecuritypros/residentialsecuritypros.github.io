<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smartphone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
