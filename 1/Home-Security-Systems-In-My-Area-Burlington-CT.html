<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
