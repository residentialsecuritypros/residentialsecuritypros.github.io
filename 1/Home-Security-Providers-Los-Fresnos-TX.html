We recommend the 8-piece security package as the best way to take full advantage of Ring's inexpensive home security choices since we know all the ins and outs of Ring Alarm. Unless you just have one door and one window, you'll need more than the only contact sensing unit that is available in Ring's five-piece kit.</p>
