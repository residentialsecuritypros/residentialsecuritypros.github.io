Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I want to make sure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>

Since family pet safe" motion sensing units can still incorrect alarm if your dog or cat jumps into the protected location or places on some weight.

Modern systems now have sensational capabilities", though these have created easy to understand misgivings about the risk for privacy and prospective abuse such capabilities produce.
