<p>Slightly more expensive than our winning wise alarm, this system was practically as basic to install and, during screening, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if among the sensing units had actually been activated. We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and just signals you when motion is produced by something with the same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no false notifies). However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have key fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
