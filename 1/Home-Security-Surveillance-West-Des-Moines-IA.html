However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have extra sensing units and crucial fobs, too.</p>
