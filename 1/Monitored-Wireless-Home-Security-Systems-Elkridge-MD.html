<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so important?  For beginners, Deep Learning allows somebody to find what they are searching for without needing to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Imagine a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the elements you are looking for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we merely type cops" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police car appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have an effective option for gathering and catching lawbreakers evidence.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
