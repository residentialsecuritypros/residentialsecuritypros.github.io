<p>As the name suggests, this alarm system is a starter set". So it's practically anticipated that it won't have actually extended customizability or a large range of features.

<p>The big perk is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that does not appear like a home security system. You can set the alarm off or contact emergency situation services direct from the app if you see a disturbance, and it rarely sends out incorrect alerts due to the fact that it tracks your phone (and other relative's phones), so understands when you're at home and turns everything off. Likewise, it will equip itself immediately when everyone has actually left.</p>
