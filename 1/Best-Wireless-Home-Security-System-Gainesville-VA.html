<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect sense of security because it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
