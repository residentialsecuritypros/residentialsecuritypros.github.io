<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
