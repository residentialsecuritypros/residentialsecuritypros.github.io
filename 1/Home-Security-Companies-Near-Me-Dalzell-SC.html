We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
