<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send out mobile phone informs with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
