Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to neglect things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
