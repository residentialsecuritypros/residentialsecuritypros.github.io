We initially saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.
