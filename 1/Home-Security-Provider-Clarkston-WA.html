<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

However, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is generally done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the consumer. </p>
