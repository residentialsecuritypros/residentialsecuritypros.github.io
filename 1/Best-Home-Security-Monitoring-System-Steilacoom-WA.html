<p>Because it's more complex than it must be, we don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days.

The alarm monitoring company will notify the authorities instantly if you do not respond or you state that it wasn't an accident.
