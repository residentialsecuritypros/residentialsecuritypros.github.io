Regrettably, there are some drawbacks to Secure America shown by their low C- ranking from BBB. A bulk of the problems center around false information concerning the necessary three year contract. In reality, most clients were not aware they were making such a long term commitment. This, paired with the severe penalty for premature cancellation-100% of the staying balance plus paying for all of the equipment-may provide some pause in selecting Protect America as their home security solution.</p>
