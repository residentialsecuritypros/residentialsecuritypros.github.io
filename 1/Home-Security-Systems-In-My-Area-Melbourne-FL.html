<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually clearly attempted to provide it an attractive edge, and we have to provide credit to its capability to reveal what's going on from as much as four cameras at a time. It can be uncomfortable and slow to use on event - with the procedure of linking to the camera for a live view rather sluggish sometimes. The previous, less expensive variation of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you wish to save some money - it does have actually a cable television attached though, instead of working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit much easier to sabotage for prospective trespassers.
