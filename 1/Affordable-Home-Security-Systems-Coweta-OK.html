<p>We have actually all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". According to a report released by the Urban Institute, authorities departments across the country react to millions of false alarms from citizen and business security systems every year.

I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, because apparently they auto restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a problem, way too expensive, and not fantastic.</p>
