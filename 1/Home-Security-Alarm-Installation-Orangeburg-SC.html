<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've identified (after a knowing period).
