It's definitely worth a put on our list of the very best security cameras 2020, even if there are some problems (the photo quality isn't the greatest we have actually checked, for example).</p>

Being able to compare a person and a vehicle, for example, allows you to minimize unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're looking to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, a doorway, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
