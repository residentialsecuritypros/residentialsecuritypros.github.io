<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notices and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is poor. Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
