That isn't to state that you can't have wired home automation, since you can, but automated equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to encrypt. It isn't extremely wise. Wireless gadgets communicate more firmly and faster to other gadgets on the system and to the monitoring center (if you choose monitoring).</p>
