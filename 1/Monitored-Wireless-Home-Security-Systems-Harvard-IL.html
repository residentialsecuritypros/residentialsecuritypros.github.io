<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.. So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, due to the fact that apparently they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.

To hold and recoup expenses alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company should be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and offer physical evidence like camera video footage or a broken window to warrant authorities action.</p>
