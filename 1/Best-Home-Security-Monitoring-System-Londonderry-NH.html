<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
