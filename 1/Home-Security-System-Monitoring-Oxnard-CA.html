<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
