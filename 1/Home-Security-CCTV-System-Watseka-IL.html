Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to distinguish between an individual and a vehicle, for example, allows you to minimize unneeded alerts.
