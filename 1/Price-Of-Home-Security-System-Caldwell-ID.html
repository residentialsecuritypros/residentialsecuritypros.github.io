<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a neighborhood feline, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>

Monitors can be linked to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be established to communicate via network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
