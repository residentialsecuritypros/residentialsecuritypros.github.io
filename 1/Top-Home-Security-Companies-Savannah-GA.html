<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
