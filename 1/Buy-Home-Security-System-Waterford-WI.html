<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is absolutely something to be considered. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a fantastic alternative for long variety situations where poles and trees are not present.</p>

<p>During the spring and summer months, home security or alarm companies hire traveling sales agents to go door-to-door, making unsolicited "sales calls" on property owners. In many cases, the salesmen use high-pressure or misleading sales techniques to get potential clients to buy pricey, and often substandard, systems or equipment they do not require.</p>
