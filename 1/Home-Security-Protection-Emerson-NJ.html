<p>Slightly more expensive than our winning clever alarm, this system was practically as easy to install and, during testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if among the sensors had actually been triggered. We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and only notifies you when motion is produced by something with the same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no incorrect signals). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have key fobs and additional sensors, too.</p>
<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to ignore things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
