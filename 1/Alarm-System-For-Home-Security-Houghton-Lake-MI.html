<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was created for homeowners. It must be installed by a professional alarm installation group and, once set up, is hard to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more typical for big residential or commercial properties and are typically more pricey than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to revamp the existing wires in your home. The group will be able to recycle the existing wiring if you have actually currently set up a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system. However, if this is your very first system, the alarm installation procedure can take upwards of three hours.</p>

However ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to mention that the customer care experience varies extensively depending on the dealer you choose. </p>
