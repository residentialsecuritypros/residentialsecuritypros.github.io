<p>For the most comprehensive coverage of your residential or commercial property, you want something that includes night vision and can record at a good quality - and almost all cameras now feature a minimum of HD (1080p) resolution.

<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month.

So before you drill holes in your walls or otherwise mess up your siding, doorframe or brick, inspect your Wi-Fi speed If the connection is spotty on your wireless security camera, you'll discover significant lag times, pixelation in the live feed and other delays that make security cameras a discomfort to utilize.</p>
