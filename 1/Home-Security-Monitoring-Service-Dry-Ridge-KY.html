<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- during the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.

Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
