<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
