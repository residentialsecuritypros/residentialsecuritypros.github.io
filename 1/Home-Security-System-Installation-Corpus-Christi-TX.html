<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". This design from Samsung Wisenet will fit the costs if you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality. It ships with four smooth and white bullet-style cameras designed for indoor and outdoor use. They're equipped with night vision tech that uses infrared LEDs and smart IR to provide up to130ft (or 40m) night vision variety. Like others on our list, the DVR system deals with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our screening that the app periodically forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract may be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method approximately 5-year contracts!

By simply buying the camera, you already get things like custom-made activity zones, and TP-Link is fairly generous with its free cloud storage (2 days' worth of video history).</p>
