<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Readily Available. Standard components in most home security packages include a master control board, the control keypad, sensor pads for windows and doors and a motion sensing unit gadget. Some systems are connected to an offsite alarm monitoring service, while others have at home alarms. Naturally you can buy more equipment like surveillance cameras, glass break sensing units, CO detectors and smoke detector.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most intense frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
