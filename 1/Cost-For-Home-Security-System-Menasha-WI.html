<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
