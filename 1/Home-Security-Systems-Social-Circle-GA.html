<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. The clever bit is that the camera not just spots that people have entered its 130-degree field of vision, however it will also have a stab at recognising them too.

You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should automatically understand.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensing units, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
