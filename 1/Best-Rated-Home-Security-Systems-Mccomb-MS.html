A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that can detecting tiny distinctions in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and develops an electronic image based on information about the temperature level distinctions.

See below for the indoor variation, however this outside variation features IP65 weatherproofing: it'll remain taping whatever the British weather condition tosses at it, and can operate in temperatures from -40 ° C to 45 ° C.
