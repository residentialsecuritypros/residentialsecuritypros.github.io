<p>Because the glass housing doesn't get in the way, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they offset it in abilities. Along with being terrific for re-positioning on the fly, they are better for low-light and infrared since the glass real estate does not impede the lens.

<p>If you get a Ring camera to opt for your alarm, you'll need to pay $3 each month or $30 a year for video recording. That's a great deal.
