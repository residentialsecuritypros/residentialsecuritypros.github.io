<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to leave the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Truly annoying. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment.

Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
