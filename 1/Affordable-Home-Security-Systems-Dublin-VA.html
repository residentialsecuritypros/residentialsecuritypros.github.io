<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the needed systems is required. There are just two choices if there are no as-built files supplying performance and setup information to make this integration work. The very first option, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is not available or unwilling to provide those information) and document the geography and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to change and rip, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>

Incorrect home network configurations, flaws in the gadgets or password compromise could permit a hacker to burglarize the system and determine if anyone is home, or even seize control.

After a time, video can be compressed to save storage area, for instance.</p>
