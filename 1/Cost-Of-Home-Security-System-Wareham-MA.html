<p>The Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is much more sophisticated security camera than the Deep Guard, and it's our top suggestion if you do not want to pay for that system's expensive (but perhaps beneficial) human monitoring service.

<p>Frontpoint provides 5 packages and 2 monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester selected the Interactive strategy but ended up disappointed with its lack of live video surveillance. When she got an alarm notification while on vacation, she had no other way of evaluating whether her home had been burglarized or if her feline had managed to trip the sensing unit. It ended up being a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>

<h3>House Burglar Alarm Wareham MA 02571</h3>
<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more expensive for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are onerous, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
<p>What we like: Allied Home Security is a local company and Brinks home security dealer that offers totally free very same day installation and complimentary activation.
