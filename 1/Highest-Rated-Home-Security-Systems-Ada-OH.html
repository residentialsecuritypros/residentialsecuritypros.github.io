With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
