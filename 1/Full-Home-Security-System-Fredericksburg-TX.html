<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
