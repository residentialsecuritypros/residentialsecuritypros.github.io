<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
