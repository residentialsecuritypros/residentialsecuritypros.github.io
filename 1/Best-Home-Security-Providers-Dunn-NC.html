<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of innovation. For starters, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey).

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the variety is bad.
