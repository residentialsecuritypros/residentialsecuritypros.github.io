<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to manually stop notices (and recording, considering that it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting eight times over two months.</p>

<p>If I liked the appearance of the Nest, then I love the Hive View's design - undoubtedly the most aesthetically pleasing camera on this list.

<p>While you need to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more budget friendly subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month. This is a costly security camera, but we believe it's worth the financial investment. Increasing implementation of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Lots of sites requiring alarm setups no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>

We likewise found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
